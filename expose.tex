  This is an exposé on Chapter III of Lurie's first book~\cite{lurie09}. It is meant to be an aid to studying the chapter. We begin with an introduction of Quasi-categories, and orient the reader towards cartesian fibrations. Then, after a brief section on fibrations of simplicial sets, we delve into the main propositions and theorems on \Catinf. The work was done as a part of the course Catégories supérieures, taught by Muriel Livernet.

\section{Introduction}

We start with the definititon of quasi-categories, or what will henceforth referred to as $\8$-categories. $K$ is an $\8$-category if inner horns can be filled ($0 < k < n$):

\begin{definition}[Simplicial nerve]
  Given a small category \C a simplex category $\Delt$, and a map $i : \Delt \rightarrow \C$, there exists a functor $N : \C \rightarrow \Set^{\op{\Delt}}$, or $\C \hookrightarrow \SSet$ called the nerve of the category, which is a simplicial set associated to the category. Applying Yoneda lemma to the Yoneda embedding $N$ yields:

  $$
    N(\C)_n = Hom(\Simplex{n}, N(\C))
  $$
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  The nerve can also be expressed as a kind of simplicial set $K$ if inner horns can be filled uniquely ($0 < k < n$):

  $$
    \begin{xy}
      \xymatrix{
      \Horn{n}{k}\ar[r]\ar@{^{(}->}[d] & K \\
      \Simplex{n}\ar@{.>}[ur]|{\exists!} &
      }
    \end{xy}
  $$
\end{lemma}

This simplicial nerve will play a crucial role in studying \8-categories, and quasi-categories are a natural extension of this definition. We will henceforth refer to quasi-categories as \8-categories.

\begin{definition}[\8-category]
  $K$ is an \8-category if inner horns can be filled ($0 < k < n$):

  $$
    \begin{xy}
      \xymatrix{
        \Horn{n}{k}\ar[r]\ar@{^{(}->}[d] & K \\
        \Simplex{n}\ar@{.>}[ur]|\exists &
      }
    \end{xy}
  $$

  Note that we drop the uniqueness condition from the nerve, because we want composition upto homotopy, not upto strict equality or isomorphism.
\end{definition}

We will now lay out some miscellanous definitions to help the reader with sections II and beyond

\section{Fibrations of simplicial sets}

\subsection{Left fibrations}
Let's start by defining certain classes of fibrations on simplicial sets, and see where that takes us in the \8-categorical world.

\begin{definition}
  A morphism $f:X\rightarrow S$ is a left fibration if $f$ has the right lifting property with respect to the horn inclusions $\Lambda_i^n\subset \Delta^n, 0\leq i < n$.
\end{definition}

Let's detail the Grothendieck construction, that gives us an equivalence between functors $\xi : \D\rightarrow \Gpd$ and the categories cofibered in groupoids over \D (where \Gpd is the category of groupoids).

\begin{definition}
  Let $F:\C\rightarrow \D$ be a functor between categories. We say that \C is cofibered in groupoids over \D
  if the following conditions are satisfied:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For every object $C \in \C$ and every morphism $\eta: F(C) \rightarrow D$ in \D , there exists a morphism $\tilde{\eta} : C \rightarrow \tilde{D}$ such that $F(\tilde{\eta}) = \eta$.
    \item For every morphism $\eta: C \rightarrow C'$ in \C and every object $C'' \in \C$, the map
          $$
            Hom_\mathcal{C}(C',C'')\rightarrow Hom_\mathcal{C}(C,C'')\times_{Hom_\mathcal{D}(F(C),F(C''))}Hom_\mathcal{D}(F(C'),F(C'')))
          $$
          is bijective.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Let \D be a small category and suppose we are given a functor $\xi: \D \rightarrow \Gpd$. We can extract a new category $\C_X$ via the classical Grothendieck construction:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the objects of $\C_X$ are pairs $(D, \eta)$, where $D \in \D$ and $\eta$ is an object of the groupoid $\xi(D)$.
  \item a morphism from $(D, \eta)$ to $(D', \eta')$ in $\C_X$ is given by a pair $(f, \alpha)$, where $f : D \rightarrow D'$ is a morphism in \D and $\alpha : \xi(f)(\eta) \simeq \eta'$ is an isomorphism in the groupoid $\xi(D')$.
\end{itemize}

There is a forgetful functor $F:\C_X \rightarrow \D$, which carries an object $(D, \eta) \in \C_X$ to the underlying object $D \in \D$. It is possible to reconstruct $\xi$ from the category $\C_X$ up to equivalence: if $D$ is an object of \D, then the groupoid $\xi(\D)$ is canonically equivalent to the fiber product $\C_X \times_\D \Pt{D}$.

It so happens that this construction provides an equivalence between functors $\xi : \D \rightarrow \Gpd$ and the categories cofibered in groupoids over \D. Let's see how the theory of left fibrations is an \8-categorical generalization of cofibered groupoids.

\begin{proposition}
  Let $F:\C\rightarrow\D$ be a functor between categories. Then \C is cofibered in groupoids over \D  if and only if the induced map $N(F):N(\C)\rightarrow N(\D)$ is a left fibration of simplicial sets.
\end{proposition}

Let's consider the structure of a general left fibration $p:X\rightarrow S$. When $S$ has a single vertex, $p$ is a left fibration if and only if $X$ is a Kan complex. By stability under pullback, we deduce that for any left fibration $p:X\rightarrow S$ and any vertex $s$ of $S$, the fiber $X_s = X\times_S\{s\}$ is a Kan complex. More precisely, suppose that $f:s\rightarrow s'$ is an edge of the simplicial set $S$
and consider the inclusion $i:X_s\simeq X_s\times\{0\} \subset X_s\times \Delta^1$. We can prove that $i$ is anodyne, and therefore solve the lifting problem:

$$
  \begin{xy}
    \xymatrix{
      \{0\}\times X_s\ar[r]\ar[d] & X \ar[d] &\\
      \Delta^1\times X_s\ar[r]\ar[ur] & \Delta^1\ar[r] & S
    }
  \end{xy}
$$

Restricting the dotted arrow to $\{1\}\times X_s$, we obtain a map $f_!:X_s\rightarrow X_{s'}$, which is uniquely determined up to homotopy.


\begin{lemma}
  Let $q : X \rightarrow S$ be a left fibration of simplicial sets. The assignment $s \in S_0 \mapsto X_s$, $f \in S_1 \mapsto f_!$ determines a functor from the homotopy category $\text{hS}$ into the homotopy category \H of spaces.
\end{lemma}

Therefore, if we take $q: X\rightarrow S$ to be a left fibration of simplicial sets, we can assign to each $\textit{object}$ of $S$ a Kan complex $X_s$, as well as a map $f_{!}: X_s \rightarrow X_{s'}$ for each edge $s \rightarrow s'$. Higher dimensional simplexes of $S$ provide coherence data for these morphisms. A left fibration therefore gives us something like a functor from a simplicial set into the \8-category of spaces. Given a simplicial set $S$, we'd like to specify the relationship between left fibrations over $S$ and functors from $S$ into spaces by exhibiting left fibrations over $S$ as the class of fibrant objects in a particular model category. This category will turn out to be $(\SSet)_{/S}$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $f:X\rightarrow S$ be a map of simplicial sets. The left cone of $f$ $C^
      {\triangleleft}f$ is the simplicial set $\displaystyle S\cup_X X^{\triangleleft} $. Dually, we can define the right cone of $f$ $C^{\triangleright}f:=\displaystyle S\cup_X X^{\triangleright}$.
\end{definition}

We can identify $S$ with a subset of $C^{\triangleleft}f$. With this identification, there is only one vertex of $C^{\triangleleft}f$ that isn't in $S$. We call it the cone point of $C^{\triangleleft}f$.

\begin{definition}[Model structure]. Let $S$ be a simplicial set. A map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ in $(\SSet)_{/S}$ is a
  \begin{itemize}
    \item covariant cofibration if it is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.
    \item covariant equivalence if the induced map \[X^{\triangleleft}\displaystyle \cup_X S \rightarrow Y^{\triangleleft}\cup_Y S\] is a categorical equivalence.
    \item covariant fibration if it has the right lifting property with respect to every map which is an acyclic covariant cofibration.
  \end{itemize}
  These maps determine a left proper combinatorial model structure on $(\SSet)_{/S}$. Combined with the natural simplicial structure, this gives us a simplicial model category structure on $(\SSet)_{/S}$.
\end{definition}

This model structure depends functorially on $S$:
\begin{proposition}
  Let $j:S\rightarrow S'$ be a map of simplicial sets. Let $J_!: (\SSet)_{/S}\rightarrow (\SSet)_{/S'}$ be the forgetful functor and let $j^*$ be its right adjoint given by $j^*X' = X'\times_{S'} S$. Then we have a Quillen adjunction
  \[(\SSet)_{/S}\underset{j^*}{\overset{j_!}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\leftarrow}}}.\]
\end{proposition}

This model structure has nice properties: for instance, every left anodyne map in $(\SSet)_{/S}$ is a covariant equivalence, every left anodyne map is a trivial cofibration, and most importantly: every covariant fibration is a left fibration of simplicial sets, and every fibrant object of $(\SSet)_{/S}$ determines a left fibration $X\rightarrow S$.

\subsection{Kan fibrations}
Kan fibrations are a subclass of left fibrations. They turn out to be exactly the ones for which the edge maps $f_!:X_s\rightarrow X_{s'}$ are isomorphisms in the category of spaces.

Let $p:X\rightarrow Y$ be a left fibration of simplicial spaces. Then $p$ is a Kan fibration if and only if for every edge $s\rightarrow s'$ in $S$, the map $f_!:X_s\rightarrow X_{s'}$ is an isomorphism in the category of spaces.
We can add a few remarks about specific instances where left fibrations are Kan fibrations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Any left fibration mapping into a Kan complex is automatically a Kan fibration.
  \item Any left fibration $p:X\rightarrow Y$ such that for each vertex $y\in Y$, the fiber $X_y$ is contractible is a trivial Kan fibration.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Straightening and unstraightening, in the unmarked case}

Let's look more precisely at the way we can view a left fibration $X\rightarrow S$ as a functor from $S$ into an $\8$-category of Kan complexes. \\
Let us fix a simplicial set $S$, a simplicial category $\mathcal{C}$, and a functor $\phi:\mathscr{C}[S]\rightarrow \mathcal{C}^{op}$. Consider an object $X\in(\SSet)_{/S}$, and let $v$ be the cone point of $X^{\triangleright}$. We can view the simplicial category
\[\mathcal{M} = \mathscr{C}[X^{\triangleright}]\displaystyle \cup_{\mathscr{C}[X]}\mathcal{C}^{op}\] as a correspondence from $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ to $\{v\}$, which we can identify with a simple functor
\[(St_\phi X)(C)=\text{Map}_\mathcal{M}(C,v).\]
We can consider $St_\phi$ as a functor from $(\SSet)_{/S}$ to $(\SSet)^\mathcal{C}$. We call it the straightening functor associated to $\phi$.
The straightening functor has a right adjoint, the unstraightening functor, denoted by $Un_\phi$ which satisfies functoriality properties.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $S$ be a simplicial set, $\mathcal{C}$ a simplicial category, and $\phi:\mathscr{C}[S]\rightarrow\mathcal{C}^{op}$ a simplicial functor. The straightening and unstraightening functors determine a Quillen adjunction
  \[(\SSet)_{/S}\dashv \SSet^\mathcal{C}\]
  where
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Simplicial categories, and their \texorpdfstring{$\8$-categories}{∞-categories}}
\subsection{The Joyal model structure}
\subsection{Cartesian fibrations}

\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{Cat}_\8$}{Cat∞}}

\begin{definition}[\Catinf]
  The simplicial category \Catinfdel is defined as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The objects are small \8-categories.
    \item Given two \8-categories \C and \D, we define $\Map_{\Catinfdel}(\C, \D)$ to be the largest Kan complex contained in the \8-cateogry $\Fun(\C, \D)$.
  \end{itemize}

  \Catinf denotes the simplicial nerve $\text{N}(\Catinfdel)$, and is referred to as the \8-category of small \8-categories whose mapping spaces are Kan complexes, and composition is strictly associative.
\end{definition}

The Joyal model structure on \SSet is not compatible with the usual simplicial structure. We will introduce marked simplicial sets $\SSet^+$ as a remedy to the problem, so that we obtain an equivalance of simplicial categories $\Catinfdel \simeq (\SSet^+)^\circ$.

\begin{definition}[Marked simplicial set]
  A marked simplicial set is a pair $(X, \epsilon)$, where $X$ is a simplicial set and $\epsilon$ is a set of edges of $X$, which contains every degenerate edge. We will say that $X$ is marked if it belongs to $\epsilon$. A morphism $(X, \epsilon) \rightarrow (X', \epsilon')$ is a map $f : X \rightarrow X'$ having the property that $f(\epsilon) \subseteq \epsilon'$.

  Every simplicial set may be regarded as a marked simplicial set, with two extreme cases deserving special mention: $S^\# = (S, S_1)$ denotes the marked simplicial set in whic every edge of $S$ is marked, and $S^b = (S, s_0(S_0)$ denotes the marked simplicial set in which only the degerate edges of $S$ are marked. We let $(\SSet^+)_{/S}$ denote the category which might otherwise be denoted as $(\SSet^+)_{/S^\#}$.
\end{definition}

We will soon introduce the cartesian model structure on $(\SSet^+)_{/S}$, and in particular see that each $(\SSet^+)_{/S}$ is a simplicial model category whose fibrant objets are the Cartesian fibrations $X \rightarrow S$.
